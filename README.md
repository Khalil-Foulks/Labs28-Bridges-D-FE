# Project Overview

 #### Bridges to Prosperity is a nonprofit that helps build footbridges in east African communities. They have collected a lot of data about various villages and we need to match it to government data. Afterwards, we will create predictions and visualizations as to where are the best places for footbridges.

##  Key Features

- Visualize Bridge Data on a Map
- Ability to filter through different bridge completion stages
- Ability to see multiple bridge completion stages at once
- Use of map clustering, enhances map performance by an icon with the amount of bridges in an area.
     as you zoom in the bridge point appears.
- Dashboard containing graphs, charts, and tables to visualize bridge data

# APIs

## [Deployed DS API](http://b2p2018-finalmerge1.eba-4apifgmz.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

This API supplies the map with all of its data points. The deployment is documented using Swagger. Currently modeling is not included in this deployment.

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

üö´These are the fields you will need to set up your project, replace them with the specifics for your app

    
    *  REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=example - obtain from TPL
    *  REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER_URI="https://example-882474.okta.com" - obtain from TPL
    *  REACT_APP_API_URI=http://localhost:8005 - obtain from TPL
    *  REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN=example - obtain from TPL
